_In this post we'll talk about convolution matrix implementation and gray scale._

import ImageSketch from "../../../src/sketches/image"

## Convolution Matrix (Hardware)

This is a convolution matrix implementation, don't know how to use it? Let's talk about it.

- __Box Blur:__ Press 'v'
- __Edge 1:__ Press 'e'
- __Edge 2:__ Press 'r'
- __Edge 3:__ Press 't'
- __Sharp:__ Press 's'
- __Identity:__ Press 'i' (This is useless but maybe someone want to see the same image twice)

_Note: Please be patient, without hardware this could be a little bit slow :D_
