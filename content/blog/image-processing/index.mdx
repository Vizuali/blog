_In this post we'll talk about Ascii and how it's been proved useful for primitive image display._

import ImageSketch from "../../../src/sketches/image" 

## This is the first post with p5.js

Below you have an sketch made with p5.js.
The basic idea around it is very simple.
You have an image/capture and iterate over all of its pixels.
For each pixel, you calculate luminance or density of light.
And then map it to an array of (already) ordered ascii characters by density.

\*_(You'll have to enable the camera for the sketch to work)_

  {typeof window !== 'undefined' && <ImageSketch/>}
